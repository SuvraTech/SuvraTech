How to replace the Galactic Tales image

1) Put your actual image file (e.g. the attachment you provided) in this folder and name it exactly `galactic.png`.
2) Refresh `products.html` in your browser. The page will show the real image. If the image is missing or empty, a simple SVG placeholder will show instead.

If you'd like, I can replace `galactic.png` with the image you attached — upload it to the workspace and I'll save it in place.
